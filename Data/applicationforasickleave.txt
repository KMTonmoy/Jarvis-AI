Here is an example of a simple application for a sick leave in Python:
```
# Define a function to ask for user input
def get_user_input():
  name = input("Enter your name: ")
  reason = input("Enter the reason for sick leave: ")
  num_days = int(input("Enter the number of sick days: "))
  return name, reason, num_days

# Define a function to generate the application
def generate_application(name, reason, num_days):
  print("Sick Leave Application")
  print("---------------------")
  print("Name: ", name)
  print("Reason: ", reason)
  print("Number of sick days: ", num_days)
  print("Date: ", datetime.date.today())

# Main function
def main():
  name, reason, num_days = get_user_input()
  generate_application(name, reason, num_days)

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```
This program will ask the user for their name, reason for sick leave, and number of sick days. It will then generate a simple application with the provided information.

Here's an example output:
```
Enter your name: DevTonmoy
Enter the reason for sick leave: Fever
Enter the number of sick days: 2
Sick Leave Application
---------------------
Name:  DevTonmoy
Reason:  Fever
Number of sick days:  2
Date:  2023-03-01
```
Note: This is a very basic example and you can customize it as per your needs.

Also, you can use this as a console-based application or you can create a GUI-based application using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
